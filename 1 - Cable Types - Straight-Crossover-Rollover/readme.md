These 3 types of cables are used to make connections between the network elements.
Rollover cable is used for console connections to the switch or routers.
Crossover cable is used if the same type of devices connected to each other (like switch to switch, router to router, etc.) If you connect pc directly to the router before connecting to a switch (which is not usually the case) also crossover cable is used.
Straight-through cable is used between switch to other elements (except hub, which is also crossover).
In the attached lab you can easily check which type of cable you should use and also by using the auto connection button between other elements that you want to try. (Ports are selected randomly, but cable type is correct normally if you will not be using fiber etc)

If you want to see the differences between the cables you can check the picture attached which I had downloaded from the below site. (you can google anyway, but this was the first site for me when I googled)
