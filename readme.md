CCNA LABS for 200-301 exam.
I got interested in networking around 8-9 months ago.
A few times give a break and always continue till I finally get my certification end of October 2022.
I suggest following Jeremy’s courses online from YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@JeremysITLab ). He is really getting into topics deeply and has a good way of relaying the information which will be needed. Sometimes he gives more than what is needed, but it is always better to know more about networking. (And he always informs which are out of topic. But of course, topics are updated and it should be better to check from Cisco’s site.)
Moreover, when I got bored I was following Chuck  (https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) to get inspired by new technologies and virtualization.
Currently interested in network automation and I am also following Azure courses from Microsoft’s learning site.
I hope you will like what I share here because this is my first time using GitHub. I will try to make some videos about the labs to make them more clear.
