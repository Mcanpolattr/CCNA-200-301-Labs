CCNA Labs for the 200-301 exam. 
I became interested in networking in the second half of 2022. I took a few breaks, but I always continued until I finally obtained my certification at the end of October 2022. I suggest following Jeremy's courses online on YouTube. He delves deeply into topics and has a good way of conveying information that will be helpful. Sometimes he provides more information than is necessary, but it's always better to have a solid understanding of networking. (He also informs you when he goes off-topic, but keep in mind that topics are updated, so it's better to check Cisco's site.) Moreover, when I got bored, I followed Network Chuck to get inspired by new technologies and virtualization.
Recently, I decided to create some videos about the labs I prepared and will be sharing them on YouTube.
