In this lab, we will be implementing EIGRP and RIP dynamic routing protocols. Both are using distance Vector algorithms. (OSPF uses Link State) 

All the IP addresses, VLan network addresses are given in the topology.
In this LAB used RIP between routers 1 and 2. And every router used EIGRP also aside. In 2 and 3 EIGRP setting used different AS numbers, so they can not reach each other.

You can play with the setting as you desire. All routers have DHCP on themselves, so feel free to change the connections and can also put a switch on the center and connect the router to there to reach each other directly, or you can put 2 switches.

Tips:
Do not forget to add passive interfaces so advertisements will not be carried to unnecessary devices.
