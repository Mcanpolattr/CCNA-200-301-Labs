In this lab, we will be implementing OSPF dynamic routing protocol. (OSPF uses Link State) 

All the IP addresses, VLan network addresses are given in the topology.
You should create the OSPF setup, according to the areas given. (All loopback interfaces on the middle routers can be put to area0.

Tips:
Do not forget to add passive interfaces so advertisements will not be carried to unnecessary devices.
You can also define the OSPF setup directly on the interfaces with the command “ip ospf 1 area X”
